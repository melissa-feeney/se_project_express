# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. I gained an understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

### Technologies Used

JavaScript was used to write the application logic. Web frameworks used - Express.js & Node.js - to simplify routing, middleware, and request handling.

MongoDB was used to retrieve data. Error handling and validation was checked using Postman and Compass.
